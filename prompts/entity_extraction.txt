-Goal-
Given a text document relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
-Steps-
Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

Now, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as found above.
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as found above.
- relationship_description: explanation as to why the source and target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
Return output(in not more than 500 tokens) in English and use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter. Finally, output {completion_delimiter}
